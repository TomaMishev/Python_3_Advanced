# Write a program that reads students' names and their grades and adds them to the student record. On the first line,

# their grade. For each student print all his/her grades and finally his/her average grade, formatted to the second
# decimal point in the format: "{student's name} -> {grade1} {grade2} ... {gradeN} (avg: {average_grade})". The order
# in which we print the result does not matter.
