# You are going to create a game called "Miner". First, you will receive the size of a square field in which the miner
# should move. On the second line, you will receive the commands for the miner's movement, separated by a single
# space. The possible commands are "left", "right", "up" and "down". In the end, you will receive each row of the
# field on a separate line. The possible characters that may appear on the screen are: •	* - a regular position on
# the field •	e - the end of the route •	c - coal •	s - miner The miner starts moving from the position "s". He
# should perform the given commands successively, moving with only one position in the given direction. If the miner
# has reached the edge of the field and the following command indicates that he has to get out of the area,
# he must remain in his current position and ignore the command. When the miner finds coal, he collects it and
# replaces it with "*". Keep track of the collected coal. In the end, you should print whether the miner has succeeded
# in collecting the coal or not and his final position: •	If the miner has collected all coal in the field,
# the program stops, and you should print the message: "You collected all coal! ({row_index}, {col_index})". •	If the
# miner steps at "e", the game is over (the program stops), and you should print the message: "Game over! ({
# row_index}, {col_index})". •	If there are no more commands and none of the above cases had happened, you should
# print the message: "{number_of_remaining_coal} pieces of coal left. ({row_index}, {col_index})". Input •	Field size
# - an integer number •	Commands to move the miner - a sequence of directions, separated by single whitespace (" ")
# •	The field: some of the following characters ("*", "e", "c ", "s"), separated by a single whitespace (" ") Output
# •	There are three types of output as mentioned above. Constraints •	The field size will be a 32-bit integer in the
# range [0 … 2 147 483 647] •	The field will always have only one "s"
