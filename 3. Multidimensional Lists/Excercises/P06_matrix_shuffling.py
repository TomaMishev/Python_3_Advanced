# Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and performs certain operations with its elements. User input
# is provided similarly to the problems above - first, you read the dimensions and then the data. Your program should
# receive commands in the format: "swap {row1} {col1} {row2} {col2}" where ("row1", "col1") and ("row2", "col2") are
# the coordinates of two points in the matrix. A valid command starts with the "swap" keyword along with four valid
# coordinates (no more, no less), separated by a single space. •	If the command is valid, you should swap the
# values at the given indexes and print the matrix at each step (thus, you will be able to check if the operation was
# performed correctly). •	If the command is not valid (does not contain the keyword "swap", has fewer or more
# coordinates entered, or the given coordinates are not valid), print "Invalid input!" and move on to the following
# command. A negative value makes the coordinates not valid. Your program should finish when the command "END" is
# entered.

    return row < 0 or col < 0 or row >= rows or col >= cols

        print(f"Invalid input!")
